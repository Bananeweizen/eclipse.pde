<h3>
1. General</h3>

<h4>
1.1 Multi-page editors do not resize lists when workbench is resized</h4>
When a multi-page editor contains a page that shows a number of items in
a list, and workbench is resized (for example, the window is maximized),
individual list items do not resize to use the new space. If there was
no space to fit the items without truncating them and using '...', resizing
will not help. This is a known problem that affects the following PDE editors:
<ul>
<li>
Plug-in manifest editor</li>

<li>
Fragment manifest editor</li>

<li>
Component manifest editor</li>

<li>
Build properties editor</li>
</ul>

<h4>
1.2 'Enter' is needed to commit new value in the Properties view</h4>
When objects shown in PDE editors are modified through the Properties view,
it is necessary to press "Enter" to commit the new value. The only exception
is when focus is moved to another row within the view. Failing to do so
can cause loss of changes because editor will not be aware of them and
will not prompt you to save.
<h4>
1.3 Restrictions on use of NL charactres in identifiers</h4>
Eclipse restricts the character set used for plug-in, fragment and component
identifiers. Please see online help for Plug-In Development Guide, section
Reference, Other Reference Information, Plug-In Manifest for more details.
In particular, NL characters are not allowed in identifiers. However, PDE
currently does not verify the entered identifiers in fact follow the restricted
character set. If NL characters are used, the resulting projects and generated
code may not be correct.
<h3>
2 Project Wizards</h3>

<h4>
2.1 Clearing source folder entry in New Plug-in Project wizard will cause
an internal error</h4>
New Plug-in Project wizard will offer a field that defines the path of
the initial source folder. This folder will hold the first Java classes
created by the wizard itself and can be used by you to create all other
classes. You can accept the value offered by the wizard or change it to
something else. However, if you clear the field, the wizard will cause
an internal error to appear warning about IllegalArgumentException.
<p>Identical problem will occur in New Fragment Project wizard.
<h4>
2.2 Valid plug-in Id not found in New Fragment Project wizard</h4>
When the default content wizard is used as part of New Fragment Project
wizard, it will ask for the Id and version of the target plug-in. You can
set both values at the same time by pressing "Browse..." button and selecting
the plug-in from the list. If you enter the values manually, you will get
a message "Plug-in id not found" even though the id may be valid. The problem
is that both the id and the version is used to look up the plug-in and
the error appears because version is not yet set. The error will disappear
once you enter the correct version.
<p>Due to this problem, we recommend using "Browse..." button to set the
values.
<h4>
2.3 Cannot create component project without plug-ins or fragments in the
workspace</h4>
If you try to create a new component project in an empty workspace, the
wizard will initially allow you to enter values, but you will not be able
to finish the plug-in and no reason will be given.
<p>This happens because New Component project wizard needs to know about
the plug-ins and/or fragments that will be part of the component. You must
have at least one plug-in or fragment in the workspace in order to create
component projects.
<h4>
2.4 Plug-in project wizard may generate top-level class with compilation
errors</h4>
When default content wizard is used to create plugin.xml and top-level
Java plug-in class, it is possible to select a combination of check boxes
that results in a Java class that does not compile. If "Add default instance
access" is deselected but other options are left selected, code will be
generated that depends on the missing method 'getDefault()'. To avoid this,
always leave this checkbox selected.
<h3>
3 Plug-in and fragment editors</h3>

<h4>
3.1 Build path changes in the target plug-in not affecting its fragments</h4>
When a new fragment is created, its build path is composed by adding the
fragment folders and then copying the build path of the target plug-in.
This allows the fragment to 'see' all the classes that the target plug-in
sees. However, if the target plug-in is itself in the workspace (i.e. editable),
changes in its build path are not automatically propagated to all the referencing
fragments. You will need to keep them in sync manually.
<h4>
3.2 Generation of Java classes based on extension point schema information</h4>
When new extension is added in Extensions page, you need to ensure that
your plug-in has the plug-in that owns the referenced extension point in
its dependency list. PDE will warn you if you do not. If you are adding
an extension to a fragment, that will be an indication that the extension
is illegal, because a fragment can only use extension points from plug-ins
that are in the target plug-in's dependency list.
<p>In case of a plug-in, you should update your dependency list prior to
generating any Java classes for extension attributes that expect Java class
names, and also update your build path to reflect this change (you can
use "Compute Java Build Path" option from the pop-up menu in the Dependencies
page, or set up PDE to keep your build path up to date automatically in
Preferences). If you fail to do so, PDE will not be able to find expected
types and generated classes will not subclass or implement these expected
types.
<h4>
3.3 Top-level comments in plugin.xml/fragment.xml are not preserved</h4>
XML comments in plugin.xml and fragment.xml files are preserved for all
elements that are children of the top-level "plugin" and "fragment" element,
respectively. However, comments inserted before the top-level element are
not preserved. If you need to add text like copyright statements, hold
off until the very last moment and then do not try to use non-source pages.
If you do, the comments will be wiped out.
<h4>
3.4 Renaming the plug-in/fragment project</h4>
There are several issues with renaming the plug-in or fragment project:
<ol>
<li>
Project name must be the same as plug-in/fragment Id. You must rename both
at the same time to keep them in sync. However, the 'Id' field in the editor
is read-only. You need to switch to the Source page and change the 'id'
attribute of the 'plugin' or 'fragment' XML element (near the top of the
file).</li>

<li>
Manifest editor will generate internal errors if project is renamed while
it the editor is opened. If you must rename the project, first change the
'id' attribute as described above, close the editor, then rename the project.
You can then reopen the editor and continue working.</li>

<li>
Note that plug-in Id is used to reference the plug-in in various places.
When this value is changed, the following may be broken:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Fragments that reference the plug-in by its Id</li>

<li>
Extensions that reference extension points defined in this plug-in (plug-in
id is part of the extension point Id).</li>

<li>
Dependency lists of other plug-ins that depend on your plug-in</li>

<li>
Components that your plug-in is part of</li>
</ul>
</ol>
Changing the plug-in Id has widespread consequences and should be performed
with caution once a significant dependency has been built on it.
<h3>
4 Running and debugging</h3>

<h4>
4.1 PDE launchers not in the launcher wizard</h4>
If you select an object in the Navigator or Packages view that cannot be
linked to any specific launcher, a wizard will pop-up offering you to select
a launcher to run that object. This wizard will not contain PDE launchers
"Run-time Workbench" and "Run-time Workbench With Tracing".
<p>In order to invoke these launchers, you need to select a resource that
belongs to a PDE project or a PDE project itself and press on the down
arrow on either "Run" or "Debug" tool bar buttons. Once you did invoke
them this way at least once, you can reuse the launcher from the "Run"
or "Debug" tool bar button shortcut menu.
<h4>
4.2 Cannot run or debug on Linux when Eclipse installation directory contains
whitespace characters</h4>
Because of a Core problem in the processing of command line path arguments
with spaces and quotes around them, Linux users who will be using PDE should
not install the platform to a location whose path contains whitespace characters.
